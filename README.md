# php-shopping

This is a php project meant as a mandatory assignment. The idea was a simple (code-wise) e-commerce website. The time(or the lack of it), made it a requirement to make things work in a non-optimal way. This is the reason for the code to have an object oriented aproach but in some pages using built-in scripting.
